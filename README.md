# Information about this script

This Bash script reads user information from a file (`user.txt`) and performs basic validation checks on names, email addresses, and IDs. It includes functions to determine whether an ID is even or odd and validates email addresses using a regular expression.

## To use the script file 

1- create a file named 'script.sh' to create the script in it
```
touch script.sh
```

2- Ensure the script has execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh

   ```



3- Create a file named 'user.txt' with lines containing three fields separated by commas: name, email, and ID.
```
touch user.txt

```
4- Run the script
```
./script.sh

```
